# Predicting Friction Angle of Bangkok Sand Using SPT

This project investigates the relationship between Standard Penetration Test (SPT) N-values and the friction angle of Bangkok Sand. It leverages a machine learning model, specifically a TensorFlow implementation, to establish a predictive framework. This repository provides the model architecture, pre-trained weights (if applicable), and potentially code for training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Key Features

* Predicts Friction Angle: Estimates the friction angle of Bangkok Sand based on SPT N-values.
* Machine Learning Approach: Utilizes a TensorFlow model, likely a neural network architecture, for accurate and efficient predictions.
* Pre-trained Weights (Optional): May include pre-trained model weights for immediate use (if training data is unavailable).
* Codebase (Optional): Might contain code for training the model from scratch, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new data.
